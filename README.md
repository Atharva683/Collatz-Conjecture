Collatz Conjecture Visualizer
This Python program explores the Collatz Conjecture, a mathematical sequence that starts with any integer 
𝑛
n. The conjecture follows these rules:

If 
𝑛
n is even, divide it by 2.
If 
𝑛
n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Repeat the process until 
𝑛
n reaches 1, falls into a cycle, or stops due to other constraints (e.g., large numbers).
The program handles both positive and negative integers, detects cycles, and provides a visualization of the sequence, along with key statistics.
