Collatz Conjecture Visualizer
This Python program explores the Collatz Conjecture, a mathematical sequence that starts with any integer 
𝑛
n. The conjecture follows these rules:

If 
𝑛
n is even, divide it by 2.
If 
𝑛
n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Repeat the process until 
𝑛
n reaches 1 or falls into a cycle.
The program provides a visualization of the sequence, detects cycles, and displays key statistics about the sequence.
